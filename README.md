## ğŸš€ Major Project: Sales vs Advertising

## ğŸ“Š Project Overview

This project identifies the linear relationship between **Sales** and **Advertising Spend** using a simple linear regression model. The objective is to understand how advertising influences sales and visualize this relationship with a regression line, enabling data-driven business insights.

## ğŸ”‘ Key Features

- Clean and minimal EDA on real-time advertising data  
- Implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model  
- Scatter plot with a regression line for visualization  
- Valuable insights into the relationship between marketing spend and sales  
- Foundation for business-focused predictive modeling
